# ColorCubeSwift

This a swift port from the original version written in Objective-C you can find the
original version [here](https://github.com/pixelogik/ColorCube) I've tried to replicate
the Objective-C version as faithful as possible but some functions signature might
differ.

This version also includes a cocoa pod spec so it can be install using

```
pod 'ColorCubeSwift'
```
